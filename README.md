# ModKit  
**A simple, open source, web surfing mod kit** that allows you to **“surf the web your way 🌊🏄‍♂️🤙”**

**ModKit** is a no-nonsense, developer-focused, open source Chrome extension for customizing websites on the fly.  
Inject CSS to restyle layouts, use JavaScript to tweak behavior, or insert custom HTML — all scoped per site.  
Perfect for devs who want persistent control without bloated UIs.  
Inspired by Arc Browser’s *Boosts* feature, but with full transparency and tweakability.
